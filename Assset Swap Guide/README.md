# Palworld Guide: How to make asset swaps
This guide will go on how to make an asset swap mod for Palworld. After reading this guide, you should be able to create asset swaps of and not limited to: Rigged 3D assets such as Pals or NPCs, static 3D assets such as items, weapons or any object, textures such Pal textures, Player textures or World textures and images such as icons or HUD elements.

## Required tools:

**FModel** (https://fmodel.app/) to go through game files and export them.\n
**Palworld mapping file** ([direct download](https://github.com/KURAMAAA0/PalModding/raw/main/Assset%20Swap%20Guide/Mappings.usmap "direct download")), required to use FModel on Palworld.\n
**Unreal Engine 5.1.1** (https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download) to package the final mod.\n
Be sure to select 5.1.1, as it is the version matching the one Palworld used.\n
**Blender** (https://www.blender.org/download/) to edit and export the 3D models.\n
DarklightGames' psk/psa importer (https://github.com/DarklightGames/io_scene_psk_psa/releases) to import game files into Blender.\n

Let's begin.
